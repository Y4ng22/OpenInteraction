# Customer Service Voice Agent Example

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_ZH.md)

A runnable retail / airline customer service demo. The voice frontend handles conversation,
identity verification and lookups, and delegates business operations to a backend agent over A2A.
Both agents access a single business state through two MCP tool surfaces. The service validates
eligibility, amounts, inventory and approval rather than relying on the model to calculate or remember rules.

This is a local, single-call demo—not a production support system or a complete official τ-bench implementation.

## Demo

**From conversation to resolution: voice-driven order cancellation.** The recording shows
identity verification with a spoken correction, order lookup, a cancellation/refund preview,
and the result after the customer's confirmation.

## Example Scope

An opt-in [τ-bench scenario API](benchmark/README.md) loads official policies, full databases and
Python tools from a trusted local checkout. Text runners connect the official user simulator
and evaluator to the backend-only chain or the real Realtime/Gateway/A2A/MCP harness.
ASR/TTS and physical voice frontend evaluation are not covered.

The backend Agent keeps up to 50 completed task request/reply turns in memory (at most
49 previous turns plus the current request). The Gateway reuses the server-issued A2A
Context for later Tasks from the same customer. Approval previews stay attached to their
pending Task and are never replayed as reusable authorization. Resetting the business
session, switching customers, or restarting the Agent starts fresh backend history.

## Capabilities

| Area | Implemented |
|---|---|
| Retail | Email or name + ZIP verification, orders, product options/inventory, cancellation, full/partial returns, shipping address changes |
| Airline | Membership ID or name + ID suffix verification, reservations/flight status, flight search, cancellation, flight/cabin changes, checked bags, policy-based compensation |
| Business boundaries | Private lookup verification, eligibility/time windows, authority ceilings, human escalation for policy gaps |
| Confirmation | Preview before writes; commit saved operations after explicit consent; revoke approvals on decline, cancellation or timeout |
| Customer workspace | Voice calls, conversation history, identity, orders/reservations, tool audit, reset/new customer |
| Human desk | Transferred customer state and handoff context |
| Policy console | Extraction/review, decision tables, flows/tool surfaces, coverage checks, database editing, diffs, backups and audit |

Retail exchanges are not implemented. Human escalation is demo state handoff, not an external contact-center integration.

## Quick Start

Run from the repository root. Check the root `package.json` for supported Node.js versions.

```bash
npm install
npm run example:customer-service:install
```

Create `examples/customer-service/.env.local` using [.env.example](.env.example) as a reference.
Do not overwrite existing configuration. At minimum:

```dotenv
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_dashscope_api_key
DASHSCOPE_MODEL=qwen3.8-flash
QWEN_AUDIO_REALTIME_MODEL=qwen-audio-3.0-realtime-plus
QWEN_AUDIO_REALTIME_VOICE=longanqian
```

The backend uses DashScope Chat Completions; the voice frontend uses a separate Realtime WebSocket API.
Your key needs access to the corresponding models. Set `QWEN_AUDIO_REALTIME_BASE_URL` for a custom voice endpoint.
The example loads its own and the repository-root `.env.local`: process variables take precedence,
then example-local values, then root-local values.

```bash
npm run example:customer-service           # Retail: five processes
npm run example:customer-service:airline   # Airline: five processes
npm run example:customer-service:both      # Both groups: ten processes
```

| UI / service | Retail | Airline |
|---|---|---|
| Customer workspace (start here) | http://127.0.0.1:4620 | http://127.0.0.1:4720 |
| Human desk | http://127.0.0.1:4630 | http://127.0.0.1:4730 |
| Gateway built-in UI | http://127.0.0.1:18889 | http://127.0.0.1:18989 |
| Business service | http://127.0.0.1:3110 | http://127.0.0.1:3210 |
| A2A agent | http://127.0.0.1:3120 | http://127.0.0.1:3220 |

Grant microphone permission. Do not control the same call through both the workspace and Gateway UI.
Workspace HTTP/WebSocket requests use its same-origin proxy rather than direct cross-port Gateway requests.

Start the independent policy console separately:

```bash
npm run example:customer-service:console   # http://127.0.0.1:4610
```

Ctrl+C stops the bootstrap process group. Business data is in memory; restarting does not restore order mutations.

## Suggested Demo

Use the workspace reset or new-customer button before each independent scenario.

### Retail

1. Verify with `liming3021@example.com`, then ask for orders.
2. Request cancellation of `#W1082334`; listen to the item, refund and payment-method preview.
3. Decline: the order must remain pending. Request again and explicitly accept: only then should it change.
4. Try the alternative verification method: name `陈静` and ZIP `510620`, for a customer without email.

Other boundaries: `#W3301887` exceeds the authority ceiling; furniture order `#W3376900`
has no policy-defined return window. Verify each order's owner first; inspect demo data in the console.
The assistant should explain the boundary and escalate, not invent a rule.

### Airline

1. Verify with membership ID `CY10023841` and inspect reservation `CYR8801`.
2. Search the same route and request a change from `CY1201` to `CY1203`.
3. Review fees and fare difference; explicitly accept, then check reservation, seats and payment records.
4. Declining must leave the booking unchanged; flown/ineligible bookings should be refused by the service.

Flight dates shift relative to the demo anchor. Use lookup results rather than hard-coded calendar dates.

                                 Human desk reads state/handoff

Policy console ──► domains/<domain> configuration and Gateway tool surfaces
```

The frontend surface is a subset of the backend surface: verification, read-only lookups and
`transfer_to_human`. Approval-requiring writes remain backend-only. Both use the same executor and state.

The frontend retrieves the current domain's `policy.md` through knowledge retrieval.
Public web search and user-profile memory are disabled.
`guards.json` decision tables enforce most eligibility, authority and monetary rules.
`flows.json` guides ordering through the backend prompt; it is not an enforced workflow engine.

### Approval Is Not a Model-Supplied Boolean

1. The first write-tool call creates a preview and internal `data.approval = { token, preview }`, without mutating the DB.
2. The executor saves the tool, original arguments, token and task context, then emits `auth_required`.
3. Customers receive readable previews; tokens and internal tool instructions stay out of A2A confirmation text and model messages.
4. The frontend responds through `respond_agent_input`. The A2A adapter carries
   `qwenAudioInputResponse = { kind: 'authorization', action }` in message metadata.
5. Authorization requires explicit `accept`, `decline` or `cancel`; absent/invalid actions are rejected.
   Only accept commits the saved operation. Decline, cancellation and timeout clear pending state and revoke the token.
6. The model receives the committed result and continues the original task. Each subsequent write requires its own approval.
   Final output excludes historical progress and earlier confirmation questions.

Approvals are keyed by taskId, expire after five minutes, are single-use, and bind an action and subject.
Flight/cabin changes additionally bind target, original booking state and quote; drift is rejected.
Tokens do not replace accurate consent recognition: the voice frontend must still interpret the customer's answer correctly.
The local A2A service lacks production authentication; do not expose it publicly.

### Reset and New Customer

The workspace stops audio and closes the old connection before coordinating `POST /api/customer-service/reset`:

- Cancel the old conversation's Gateway tasks.
- Clear backend pending operations, revoke approvals and wait for running executions to exit.
- Reset the business database and verification state.
- Reconnect with a new conversation ID, excluding old history from the new context.

The new conversation ID is stored in the current tab's sessionStorage for refresh/reconnect;
the MCP business sessionId remains fixed. Old history files are retained, not deleted.
Cleanup failures pause calls and prompt a retry rather than pretending the switch succeeded.
Direct service `reset` / `new-customer` calls only reset business data, without cross-process cleanup.

## Policy Console

Administrators can edit decision tables, flows, frontend/backend tool assignment and demo data.
Extraction runs three times; disagreements support human review instead of relying on model-reported confidence.
Gaps, conflicts and candidates without a matching policy citation require review.

“Preview and apply” validates configuration, shows diffs and coverage, then writes domain files.
Changes are backed up under `.runtime-console/backups/` and audited; partial write failures roll back.

| Change | Takes effect |
|---|---|
| Decision tables / guards | Next tool call |
| Flows | Next backend task |
| Gateway tool surface | Restart that domain's Gateway |
| Demo database | Reset the business session or restart the service |

## Tests and Evaluation

```bash
npm run test:customer-service             # Installs example dependencies, then tests all components
npm run test:customer-service:smoke       # Core in-memory regressions; no model key or local ports
npm run example:customer-service:lint
node --test server/test/a2a*.test.mjs     # Framework A2A adapter regression
```

Tests cover verification, surfaces, decision tables, writes, MCP/A2A approvals, cancellation/timeout,
per-operation approval in multi-step tasks, reset coordination, voice-client controls, configuration application
and output-audit functions. Integration tests use stub models and temporary local ports, not paid API calls.
Passing tests is not proof that real voice works end to end.

The tools and retail data borrow τ-bench structure, but this example uses trimmed/localized data and policies.
The default demo does not use the official simulator/scorer; optional adapters and runners are documented
in benchmark/README.md. Stub-model regression success rates are not official scores.
Formal evaluation must pin a benchmark version, align environments, and cover frontend verification, delegation,
approval and task continuation—not just the backend model.

## Known Limitations

- One call per domain: frontend/backend MCP still use process-fixed `CS_SESSION_ID`.
  New conversation IDs prevent old conversational context from entering the next customer, not concurrent business-state isolation.
- Business data, tasks and approvals are primarily in memory; restart recovery, durable transactions and idempotency are incomplete.
- Real voice recognition, consent interpretation, tool selection and phrasing need real-voice regression and simulated-user evaluation.
- Retail exchanges and the complete official τ-bench tool/task set are not covered.
- Output-audit functions and an HTTP endpoint exist, but are not automatically wired into live voice output or used as a pre-playback blocker.
- Workspace, agent, business API and console are local development services with administrative/reset capabilities, not production access control.
